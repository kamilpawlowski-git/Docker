# Docker
Networking Programming subject at my university required installing virtual machines to create environment where on one computer we could artificially create couple machines to act as seperate PCs. 

I decided I would do it my way and instead of installing one of virtual machines programs I taught myself how to use Docker.

**Dockerfile** and **dockercompose.yml** files were created.

Networking programming was the main focus therefore networks (both ipv4 and ipv6) were created and tools for networking like **net-tools** and **lsof** were added to very light environment of debian:10.

Afterwards I was asked by my professor to create instruction for other students (in polish) covering how to properly setup docker, it will be attached here also.
